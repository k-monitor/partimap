**Personal data provided upon registration**

When registering, the Registered User's name, email address and password are recorded and stored. The name and email address of the Registered User will be indicated in the privacy notice of the questionnaire that is part of the Project, in a way accessible to the Visitors. It is not necessary to upload a profile picture to use the Service. Acceptance of the Privacy Policy is done by checking a mandatory checkbox that has not been completed in advance.

Purpose: the handling of the personal data provided by the Registered User is necessary for his/her identification by the Data Controller in the system, for possible contact initiated by the Data Controller and for informing the Visitors who fill in the questionnaire that is part of the Project.

Subject to the User’s explicit consent, the Data Controller may use the email address provided by the User to send notifications concerning technical developments and updates related to the PARTIMAP service, as well as information on events, training sessions, and opportunities for providing user feedback in connection with the use of the system.

Legal basis for data handling: voluntary consent of the Registered User (data subject).

Duration of data handling: until revoked by the Registered User, but not longer than 5 years.

In case of unlawful or misleading use of personal data or in case of an act committed by the Registered User that endangers the operation, activity and achievement of the purposes of the Data Controller, the Data Controller is entitled to delete the Registered User's data without delay, however, in case of suspicion of criminal offence or civil liability, the Data Controller is also entitled to retain the data for the duration of the proceedings.

After registration, the Registered User may create a questionnaire by editing a form, the content of which the Registered User determines himself/herself, in compliance with the Terms of Use defined by the Data Controller. The content available to the Registered User on the form associated to the Projects and on the questionnaire accessible to the public may be textual and visual content. The Registered User may not ask the Visitors to provide personal data in the questionnaire created by him/her, in accordance with the Terms of Use.

**Technical details of using the service**

**Logging**

During the use of the Service, the system records the IP address of the Registered User's computer, the start and end time of the visit, and in some cases --- depending on the Registered User's computer settings --- the type of browser and operating system. These data are automatically logged by the system.

**Data recorded by embedded services**

Depending on the settings of the Registered User's browser and computer, different embedded services are present when using the Service. These services are necessary for the optimal use of the site:

The organisations providing embedded services have their own privacy notice and privacy policy, available at the links above, regarding the data collected and processed in the course of providing the service, but the Data Controller does not have access to or use the data. Furthermore, these services can be deactivated, at the Registered User's discretion, by means of the appropriate browser settings, but they will lead to a deterioration in the quality of the use of the site.

**Tracking**

When you use the site, we also use tracking tools to track traffic and activity on the site so that we can collect anonymised statistics on the number of visitors:

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) generates site traffic statistics by encrypting and partially capturing IP addresses. No other data that can be recorded and stored by the application is used. The anonymised statistics are stored for 1 year.

As the Data Controller, we do not link tracking data to personal data, but we do not have the right to decide on their possible further use. This data is governed by the privacy principles and policies of Google LLC ("Google", 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States of America), the embedded application developer. If the Registered User wishes to use the site without a tracker, the Registered User may explicitly [opt out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Cookies**

Cookies are only used by the site to store the Registered User's login and are automatically deleted after 30 days.

4.2. The following data is handled by the **Data Controller and, after registration, by the Registered User**, broken down by the activities that may be carried out with the Service:

- the right to information and access: the Registered User may request information about the personal data stored in relation to him or her and may request a copy of such data;
- the right to rectification: the Registered User may request the rectification of personal data stored about him/her if they are inaccurate or incomplete. If the Registered User also provides the Data Controller with personal data which is not necessary for the purposes of the processing, the Data Controller shall delete it.

- right to restriction of handling: the Registered User may request the restriction of handling if a) he/she contests the accuracy of the personal data and requests the restriction of handling for the period of time necessary for the Data Controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; b) the handling is unlawful but the Registered User opposes the erasure of the data and requests instead the restriction of their use; c) the Data Controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the handling but the Registered User requires them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

The right to data portability must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
- the right to object: the Registered User may object to the handling of his or her personal data on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, if the handling is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, in the exercise of official authority, or for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party. When providing the Service, the Data Controller handles the Registered User's data with the Registered User's consent, and therefore objections may only be raised in the case of mandatory data handling (e.g. ad hoc data transfers) that must be carried out even without consent.
- right to redress: see point 7.

## 7\. Redress possibilities

**Collaboration with the Data Controller**

If the Registered User experiences unlawful data handling, it is advisable to send the complaint to the Data Controller first before initiating a formal procedure, as this will allow the Data Controller to restore the lawful situation.

**Complaint**

The Registered User may lodge a complaint with the National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) in case of a breach of the handling of personal data concerning him/her.

Proceedings against the Data Controller shall be brought before the competent court of the place where the Data Controller is established or, at the choice of the data subject, of the place of residence or domicile of the data subject. The court shall decide the case on a fast-track basis.
