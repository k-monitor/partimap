**Some notes on the files having `lang-key.default.md` filename structure:**

These files are only used as a fallback if the `i18n` database table doesn't have a record with matching `lang` and `key` values.

These files in the repository are updated manually, and may be out of date compared to what is visible on our production site on <https://www.partimap.eu/>.
