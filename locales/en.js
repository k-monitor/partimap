		column1: 'When was the last time you were asked for your opinion on a development project that would impact your everyday life? Billions of euros are being used to renovate our urban spaces, public buildings and transport facilities. But public consultation and stakeholder involvement is often reduced to a formality. It is clear however that in order for a project to be successful, the needs and concerns of the people who use the new infrastructure on a daily basis must be taken into account alongside professional considerations. The modernization of a station is not the goal in itself, but rather to increase the number of people travelling by train. Smart benches don\'t make a public square a community place, only locals, if they grow to like it.',
		column2: 'Participatory mapping is a process by which the invaluable knowledge of stakeholders is incorporated into community developments designed for their benefit. PARTIMAP\'s map-based survey application makes engaging with local stakeholders quicker, simpler and more efficient. It is free to use after registration, has customizable design features, and can also be freely developed as it is an open source platform. Whether you represent a public body, a municipality or a local advocacy group, if you\'re looking for a smart and transparent way to get to know the views of your community, try PARTIMAP and join its development!',

				title: 'Easy to edit',
				description:
					'<p>With PARTIMAP it is easy to create surveys with various map-based and traditional questionnaire functions. Its interface is designed to allow ordinary computer users to enter questions, create worksheets, share on social media and publish a new project.</p><p>When creating a new project after registering in the application, it is first required to enter basic information such as the project title, the data holder and the text of the welcome page. Subsequently it is possible to create the relevant worksheets. These can be text pages (to present plans and ideas), questionnaires (to collect responses from multiple-choice, drop-down menus, free-text and scale questions), static maps (to present and collect feedback on pre-defined map elements - points, lines and polygons), and interactive maps (where respondents can draw and add their own map elements in response to a question). It is easy to navigate among worksheets, delete them or edit their content and their sequence at any time.</p>',

				title: 'Customizable design',
				description:
					'<p>Questionnaire interfaces are designed to reach the target audience effectively. For this reason, we paid particular attention to the shareability and customisability of projects during development. On the landing and closing worksheets, sharing buttons for the most popular social media platforms are available. Projects can also be set up with a custom Facebook thumbnail image and preview text, allowing users to tailor their survey to their own established designs. In addition to uploading your own photos in the worksheet editing interface, you can also format text, add links and upload background images. In addition, projects can be given a unique url (partimap.eu/en/p/NAME) in the application.</p>',
			},
			{
				title: 'A multi-faceted survey',
				description:
					'<p>The site\'s questionnaire worksheet can be used to create surveys unrelated to the map feature. The questions can take the form of multiple-choice options, drop-down menus, scaled ratings or text responses - these can be freely customised by adding your own images and additional options. The summary (results) of the answers given by the respondents can be published in chart form at the end of the worksheet with a single click, and the option to display the results on the page after ending the survey period is also provided. The worksheet can be customised in the same way as the other worksheets: background images, illustrations and links can be used to make it more user-friendly.</p>',
			},
			{
				title: 'Mapping existing plans',
				description:
					'<p>A static map worksheet can be added to the questionnaire to illustrate a particular transport, infrastructure or other development or development idea that can be depicted on a map and to collect feedback on it. It is possible to import elements from other mapping interfaces (e.g. Google Maps), which can then be visualised and evaluated individually in PARTIMAP. In addition, the map-based worksheet can include the question types already familiar from the questionnaire, as well as additional explanations, descriptions and links. The edited map can be saved as your own map and used in a future project as well.</p><p>The static map is an ideal tool for asking residents to rate the different infrastructures of a municipality, e.g. accessibility in general and for people with reduced mobility, whether it is bike-friendly, etc. Once the results are in, a complex assessment can be derived. This type of worksheet can also be used to solve specific development dilemmas, e.g. by reviewing the A and B versions of a planned development for an area, respondents can decide which they prefer.</p>',

				title: 'Now it\'s your turn to contribute to the map!',
				description:
					'<p>What makes PARTIMAP unique compared to other online survey tools is that people can express their opinion with a location attached, can illustrate their suggestions or simply share their commuting routes for example. The public spaces in a municipality, district or neighbourhood are used by a wide range of people, whose diverse needs and opinions on their use of space can be assessed using the interactive map worksheet. Respondents can use points, lines and polygon shapes to provide graphical answers to the questions asked. The incoming responses can be easily processed either in the form of a heat map, or the suggestions received can be voted on a static map in a subsequent questionnaire.</p>',
			},
			{
				title: 'Interoperability with other platforms',
				description:
					'<p>Both map worksheets use openstreetmap.org as a background map, for which a custom base map can be drawn highlighting the focal points of the survey. Elements drawn in previous projects can be saved and stored among the user\'s own maps. For each worksheet, the base map can be imported not only from this own map repository, but also from an external .KML file: an import/export function provides a fast interchange with mapping software such as Google MyMaps or other more complex geospatial softwares.</p><p>The simple editing interface allows you to create maps fitting the survey by drawing coloured points, lines and polygons. With the click of a button, it is also possible to create a base map from data submitted by a survey respondent, and export to .KML file format - providing portability to other map editing applications. In the future, we also intend to create other types of raster background maps and new graphical displays of the plotted elements (e.g. custom icons).</p>',

				title: 'Communicating your results',
				description:
					'<p>Once a survey is completed, a new phase in the project cycle begins: evaluation. The responses received through the survey interface can be presented in graphs for quick communication: they can be set to display with a single setting, so that the respondents can directly browse the current results of the survey. Additionally, detailed analysis can be performed by downloading the complete dataset of responses in excel format. The report can then be processed with data management softwares using the submitted responses and geographical elements, so that the complexity and visual representation of the final results is dependent only on our data analysis and visualisation capabilities.</p>',

			{
				title: 'Free and open-source',
				description:
					'<p>The app is free to use and after a quick registration you can create your own PARTIMAP survey. Developed by K-Monitor and our partners, the tool is open-source, so it is free to develop, customise and use. Our goal is to create more projects that encourage citizens to get involved in public decision-making, so we greatly welcome the creative use and development of this tool.</p>',

					'<p>PARTIMAP software was developed by K-Monitor with the support of the European Commission (DG Regio) in 2021. Further developments were made in 2022, in cooperation with the Prague office of the Heinrich-BÃ¶ll-Stiftung. But the project is far from over with the launch of the current version! The free and open platform was created for public authorities, municipalities and NGOs with the aim of helping them enhance participation in their development decisions, so that we can manage our public assets more efficiently.</p><p>If you\'re interested in the project and would like to get involved in its development, or just want to share your thoughts on Partimap with us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@k-monitor.hu">info@k-monitor.hu</a>.
